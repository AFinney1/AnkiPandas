<summary><strong>Instructions</strong></summary>

First off, thanks for helping! :heart:

To make it easier to come up with a solution, please make sure to include

* Your operating system
* Please make sure that you set the logging level of ankipandas to debug directly after importing:
  `ankipandas.set_debug_log_level()`.
* A minimal working example (MWE) of code that can be used to reproduce your problem (where applicable)
* A clear description of what you expected and what happened instead
* The complete output of all log messages of `AnkiPandas`

Also note that it might take some time before I can take a look at this.
If I don't reply within a week, please ping me again (e.g. write another comment).
Thanks for your patience!
